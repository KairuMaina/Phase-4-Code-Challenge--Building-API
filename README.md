- Retrieve a list of heroes and their associated powers.
- Retrieve specific heroes or powers by their IDs.
- Update the description of powers.
- Add hero-power associations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate
- Alembic
- SQLite (or another database of your choice)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/superheroes-api.git
cd superheroes-api
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You can create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file (optional for configuration)

```bash
# .env file
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///heroes.db  # Adjust the database URL if you're using something else
```

## Database Initialization

After installing dependencies, you'll need to initialize and migrate the database.

1. Initialize the migrations folder:

   ```bash
   flask db init
   ```

2. Create an initial migration:

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   ```

3. Apply the migration:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

4. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```

## Running the App

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start the Flask development server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
